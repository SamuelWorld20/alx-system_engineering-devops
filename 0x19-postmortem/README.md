# Server overload that led to system crash

## Issue Summary

On 16th February 2024, from 12:58pm to 4:30pm, our system experienced a severe outage due to a sudden surge in traffic that overwhelmed the servers. This resulted in significant performance degradation, making the application slow and unresponsive, eventually leading to a complete system crash.

## Timeline (all times in West African Time)

- 12:58 PM: An unexpected and rapid increase in user traffic occurred, surpassing the system's capacity to handle the load efficiently.
- 01:05 PM: The system started experiencing performance degradation, with response times increasing and users encountering delays in accessing features.
- 01:06 PM: The monitoring system generated an alert based on predefined thresholds, signaling the operations team about the unusual increase in traffic and system load.
- 02:00 PM: The team focused on analyzing system metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, and network activity, to identify the root cause of the performance degradation.
- 02:50 PM: As the issue persisted and the system continued to degrade, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure and architecture teams for a more comprehensive review.
- 03:20 PM: The root cause was finally identified as a sudden surge in user traffic exceeding the system's capacity, causing server overload.
- 03:21 PM: Immediate actions were taken to optimize server configurations and adjust load balancing mechanisms to handle the increased traffic more efficiently.
- 03:42 PM: Throughout the incident, clear and transparent communication was maintained with users via our status page, social media channels, and direct notifications.
- 04:30 PM: Following the incident, the team implemented preventive measures, including enhanced monitoring, regular load testing, and the implementation of auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic demands.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the server overload incident was an unexpected surge in user traffic sparked by a viral marketing campaign. The rapid influx overwhelmed the system's capacity, resulting in degraded performance and a subsequent system crash. To resolve the issue, the incident response team swiftly optimized server configurations, adjusted load balancing mechanisms, and implemented auto-scaling. These measures collectively enhanced the system's ability to manage fluctuating traffic, ensuring improved performance and resilience.

## Corrective and Preventive Measures

- Optimize server configurations for peak traffic scenarios.
- Refine load balancing mechanisms for even distribution and optimized algorithms.
- Regularly optimize server configurations for peak traffic scenarios.
- Maintain refined load balancing configurations and ensure effective auto-scaling policies.
